Color Recognition with OpenCV

- Description
A simple Python project to detect a color name and display it when the user clicks on any pixel in an image.

I developed this project during my summer internship at Smart Methods.

I used OpenCV and a named color dataset to determine the closest matching color name.

- Dataset used:
The colors.csv file contains over 800 color names with their RGB values, compiled from common web color standards.

- Technologies used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- NumPy
